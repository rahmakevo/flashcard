        <h3 id="p">Javascript: </h3>
        <p id="h">Often abbreviated as "JS", is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, interpreted run-time language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.</p>


        <h3 id="a">Operators: </h3>
        <p id="b">An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations.</p>

        <h3 id="c">Variables: </h3>
        <p id="d">an element, feature, or factor that is liable to vary or change.</p>

        <h3 id="e">Variable naming conventions: </h3>
        <p id="f">a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>

        <h3 id="g">Functions: </h3>
        <p id="i">a relationship or expression involving one or more variables.</p>

        <h3 id="j">String: </h3>
        <p id="k">a sequence of characters.</p>

        <h3 id="l">Methods: </h3>
        <p id="m">is a set of code which is referred to by name and can be called (invoked) at any point in a program simply by utilizing the method's name.</p>

        <h3 id="n">Arguments:</h3>
        <p id="o">are simply one of the two types of parameters.</p>

        <h3 id="q">Parameters: </h3>
        <p id="r">The "type" of data that a method can receive.</p>

        <h3 id="s">Return: </h3>
        <p id="t">But methods are set out in a certain way. You have a method header, and a method body. The header is where you tell Java what value type, if any, the method will return (an int value, a double value, a string value, etc). As well as the return type, you need a name for your method, which also goes in the header.</p>

        <h3 id="u">Chaining Method: </h3>
        <p id="v">Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages.</p>

        <h3 id="rt">Booelans: </h3>
        <p id="w">boolean user = true; So instead of typing int or double or string, you just type boolean (with a lower case "b"). After the name of you variable, you can assign a value of either true or false. Notice that the assignment operator is a single equals sign ( = ).</p>

        <h3 id="x">Undefined: </h3>
        <p id="y">I assume you mean null.</p>

        <h3 id="aa">NaN: </h3>
        <p id="bb">NaN means "Not a Number" and is the result of undefined operations on floating point numbers like for example dividing zero by zero.</p>

        <h3 id="cc">Escape:</h3>
        <p id="dd">An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that does not represent itself when used inside a character or string literal, but is translated into another character or a sequence of characters that may be difficult or impossible to represent directly.</p>

        <h3 id="ee">Alert: </h3>
        <p id="ff">The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK.</p>

        <h3 id="gg">Comments: </h3>
        <p id="hh">The java comments are statements that are not executed by the compiler and interpreter.</p>

        <h3 id="ii">jQuery: </h3>
        <p id="jj"> jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods. jsoup implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification, and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do.</p>

        <h3 id="kk">Attributes: </h3>
        <p id="ll">An attribute is another term for a field.</p>
